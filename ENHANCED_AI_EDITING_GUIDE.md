- **Slow Motion**: For dramatic emphasis

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Scene Change Detection
```
Input: Video with multiple scene changes
Output: 
- Major change at 15.2s: Hard cut for dramatic impact
- Moderate change at 32.8s: Cross dissolve for smooth flow
- Minor change at 45.1s: Fade for subtle transition
```

### Example 2: Character-Driven Editing
```
Input: Video with multiple people
Output:
- Single face at 8.3s: Close-up for emotional connection
- Multiple faces at 12.7s: Wide shot for group dynamics
- Individual close-ups at 13.2s, 14.7s: Character focus
```

### Example 3: Script-Based Editing
```
Input: Script with emotional content
Output:
- "Suddenly" at 22.1s: Dramatic cut for revelation
- High emotion at 28.9s: Close-up for impact
- Speaker change at 31.4s: Cut to new speaker
```
